# Pre-trained Classificaton Models

The models available are the pre-trained models on DCGAN synthetic data in both original and 64x64 resized approach.

- Original: Model - DenseNet-201 - Scenario 5
- 64x64: Model - MobileNet-V2 - Scenario 6.5

Due to size limitations, the models are not stored in the GitHub repository. The Kaggle platform was choseen instead.

In order to access the pre-trained models for the Scenario 5 and 6.5 implementation please access the link below:
