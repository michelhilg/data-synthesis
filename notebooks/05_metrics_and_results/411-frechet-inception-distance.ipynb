    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of FID using PyTorch framework has some limitations, primarily because the benchmark for FID metric is defined within the TensorFlow framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the GiHub [PyTorch-FID](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) offers a definition that closely aligns with the TensorFlow results. It is widely recognized as one of the most popular PyTorch applications for FID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This thesis follows the FID defined in the GitHub mentioned above, working as a library that execute the commands over terminal to computes the FID values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Th following cell highlight the process of installing and using the library."
