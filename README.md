# Deep Generative Models for Data Synthesis in Manufacturing

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and information related to a bachelor thesis titled "Deep Generative Models for Data Synthesis in Manufacturing". The thesis focuses on the generation of synthetic images in the manufacturing domain using deep generative models techniques. The primary goal of this study is to apply and compare different deep generative models for synthetic image augmentation in order to perform a DL-model-based visual quality inspection in a complex manufacturing use case with limited data
